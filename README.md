# It's a Carlucci Compton Party!

Hey! I got engaged, this repo powers what will eventually is going to be our wedding site at [carlucci-compton.party](https://carlucci-compton.party).

This site is also a POC to see _just_ how much you can do with ES6 and vanilla CSS without any transpiling…you'll note that [package.json](./package.json) is conspicuously absent of any build steps (at the moment, that might change as I add more functionality...no `imports` is a bit of a downer).

Pushes to `master` triggers a deploy on Netlify. This setup is based on [HTML5 boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/). 

More to come…I guess?
